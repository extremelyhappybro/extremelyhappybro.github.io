  <h1>Aerodynamics</h1>
  Everything on this page was referenced from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-aerodynamics-k4.html" title="Aerodynamics at NASA" target="_blank">this website.</a>
<h2>What is it</h2>
<p>The definition of aerodynamics is the way air moves around things.
aerodynamics is what lets a plane fly. Anyhting from living things to inanimate vehicles needs to have aoredynamics in order to move throught the air. </p>

<h2>Forces of flight</h2>
<p>There are four forces in flight. They are lift, thrust, weight, and drag.
this is what makes a plane go foward, backward, up, or down.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>The definition of weight is the force of gravity. It acts in a downward directionâ€”toward the center of the Earth(as of google). One of the things that an object needs in order for it to fly is an opposing force against weight. Something lighter needs less of an upward push than a heavier object.</p>

<h3>Lift</h3>
<p>Lift is the force that directly opposes the weight of an airplane and holds the airplane in the air(as of google). Lift is the opposite force of weight. For an airplane to move upard it has to have more lift force than weight. On info on how planes produce lift watch this video below.</p>

<h3>Drag</h3>
<p>Drag is the force that slows an object down. Water and air is a good example. Water is denser so it is hader for objects to move throught water than through air.</p>
